#### The types of statistical learning

1. Predicting a continuous output
2. Predicting a class (Classification)
3. Unsupervised learning problems

#### Predicting a continuous output - Wage Data
The author uses the example of the wage data, to demonstrate how we can use one's education level, the year itself and the years of experience to attempt to predict one's wage.


#### Predicting a class - S&P Data
The author next demonstrates the possibility of predicting whether the S&P index rises or falls, based on % changes in the past 5 days.

#### Unsupervised Statistical Learning - Cancer Data
The last example revolves around reducing cancer data, from 50+ dimensions to 2, and dividing them into clusters. The key is the number of clusters, which is difficult to decide.

### Key Learning Points
1. Usage of a boxplot to demonstrate the impact of classes on a continuous variable
2. Scatterplot to demonstrate a linear / non-linear relation

#### History of Statistical learning

Interesting to note that the first successful instance of linear regression was for astronomy.

#### Matrix Mathematics

Just take note that for matrix multiplication, eg. a * b, the column number of a needs to be equal to the row number of b.
